====== README ======

QDREC (pronounced as 'QuadRec') is a web server for automatically 
determining quantal dose-response characteristics of macroparasites in phenotypic 
drug screening. Such parasites include the etiological agents of tropical 
diseases such as schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and onchocerciasis, which 
together afflict over 500 million people worldwide.
Using a combination of biological imaging and supervised machine learning, QDREC 
automatically determines the number of parasites which differ significantly from 
controls at specific experimental conditions (e.g. compound and concentration). 
This statistic is then utilized to determine the corresponding quantitative 
dose-response characteristics of the parasite population. The image analysis part 
of QDREC has been optimized with a focus on post-infective larvae (schistosomula) 
of the parasitic Schistosoma flatworm, which cause the disease schistosomiasis. 
However, the algorithmic basis underlying the methodology for determining 
dose-response characteristics in QDREC is generic and the web server can equally 
be used for analyzing other macroparasites.
QDREC is part of our effort to provide publicly available technologies that can 
be used to quantitatively, automatically, and effectively discover drugs against 
the neglected diseases of humankind.

QDREC was designed and conceived by Rahul Singh and Daniel Asarnow and implemented
by Daniel Asarnow.
