========================================================================

====== 0. Introduction ======

This document will explain step-by-step how to install QDREC and its dependencies.

QDREC fully supports the following platforms:

glnxa64 -   GNU/Linux on x86_64 (64-bit)
glnx86  -   GNU/Linux on x86 (32-bit)
win64   -   Microsoft Windows (64-bit)
win32   -   Microsoft Windows (32-bit)

QDREC also probably supports these additional platforms:

maci64  -   Apple Macintosh OS X on Intel (64-bit)

However, running QDREC on Mac will require a full MATLAB
installation (as opposed to the free MATLAB Compiler Runtime) in order to
build the correct platform-dependent PhenomJ MATLAB/Java JAR file.

Once installation is complete please double check that the required
environment variables have been correctly defined.

JAVA_HOME       Must contain path to JDK home directory
GROOVY_HOME     Must contain path to Groovy home directory
GRAILS_HOME     Must contain path to Grails home directory
MYSQL_HOME      Must contain path to MySQL home directory

PATH        <JAVA_HOME>/bin, <GROOVY_HOME>/bin, <GRAILS_HOME>/bin and
            <MYSQL_HOME>/bin must all be on the system PATH

Now proceed to the CONFIGURE file in order to configure and run QDREC.


====== 1. Install Java ======

QDREC requires the Oracle Java 7 JDK to be installed.
The most recent version of Java 7 can be found at:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

One the JDK has been installed/unpacked:
    Define the environment variable JAVA_HOME.
    JAVA_HOME must contain the installation root of the JDK, for example:
    C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_45
    
    Add $JAVA_HOME/bin (%JAVA_HOME%\bin on Windows) to the PATH.

    
====== 2. Install Groovy ======

QDREC requires Groovy 2.3 to be installed.
The most recent version of Groovy 2.3 can be found at:
http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download

Once Groovy has been installed/unpacked:
    Define the environment variable GROOVY_HOME.
    GROOVY_HOME must contain the installation root of Groovy, for example:
    C:\Program Files\Groovy\groovy-2.3.0
    
    Add $GROOVY_HOME/bin (%GROOVY_HOME%\bin on Windows) to the PATH.

    
====== 3. Install Grails ======

QDREC requires Grails to be installed. QDREC was developed using Grails 2.2,
but will probably work with later versions.

Grails can be found at:
https://grails.org/download

In order to download Grails 2.2, select "2.2" from the drop-down menu under
the "Download previous release" header.

Once Grails has been installed/unpacked:
    Define the environment variable GRAILS_HOME.
    GRAILS_HOME must contain the installation root of Grails, for example:
    C:\Program Files\Grails\grails-2.2.2
    
    Add $GRAILS_HOME/bin (%GRAILS_HOME%\bin on Windows) to the PATH.


====== 4. Install MySQL ======

QDREC requires MySQL to be installed. QDREC was developed using MySQL 5.6,
but will probably work with later versions.

MySQL can be found at:
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

Once MySQL has been installed/unpacked:
    Define the environment variable MYSQL_HOME.
    MYSQL_HOME must contain the installation root of MySQL, for example:
    C:\Program Files\MySQL\mysql-5.6.19-winx64
    
    Add $MYSQL_HOME/bin (%MYSQL_HOME%\bin on Windows) to the PATH.
    
See the QDREC documentation file CONFIGURE for information on configuring
and running MySQL for use with QDREC.


====== 5. Install MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR)

QDREC requires the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) to be installed.
The MCR is a freely distributable runtime which provides the MATLAB
functionality used in the PhenomJ Java library, containing the algorithmic
core of the QDREC software.

The WIN64 and GLNXA64 and MCR installation files can be found at:
http://tintin.sfsu.edu/software/MCR/MCRInstaller-v716-win64.exe
http://tintin.sfsu.edu/software/MCR/MCRInstaller-v716-glnxa64.zip

To install under Windows, run the installer EXE and follow the directions.

Under Linux, unpack the ZIP archive and then run the install script and
follow the directions given.

The PhenomJ JAR files distributed with QDREC require MCR version v716,
which was originally distributed with MATLAB R2011b.


====== 7. Build PhenomJ MATLAB/Java library (optional) ======

In order to run QDREC Mac OS it will be necessary to build platform-dependent
versions of the PhenomJ MATLAB/Java JAR file.

In order to build this file, first run MATLAB.
Once the MATLAB command window is open, drag the file 'phenomj.prj'
(found in the QDREC project files under the PhenomJ directory)
on to the MATLAB command window. The deployment tool GUI utility will
open automatically. Click the "build" icon and wait for the build process
to complete. When finished, the PhenomJ/phenomj/distrib directory will
contain a new JAR file, phenomj.jar, with the PhenomJ library for your
platform. When using this library, be sure to also find the correct javabuilder.jar
and MCRInstaller versions.

MATLAB/Java JARs, the javabuilder.jar file and the MCR must all be from the same
OS platform / architecture and MATLAB version.

IN CASE THE PHENOMJ.prj FILE DOES NOT WORK:

Create a new project using the MATLAB deploytool command.
The command will open the deploytool GUI.
Choose to create a Java package in the PhenomJ directory
in the QDREC project files.

Then, configure the MATLAB path. Click "Add with subfolders"
and select the PhenomJ/MATLAB directory in the QDREC files.
Save the path.

Next, create a new class in the deploytool project.
Name the class 'PhenomJ' (case sensitive).
Then click 'add files' and add the following five files
from the PhenomJ/MATLAB directory:

    classifierType.m
    classifyOnly.m
    imageDatabase.m
    resegmentDatabase.m
    trainOnly.m

Now, click the "build" icon and follow the instructions given above.
