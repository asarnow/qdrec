====== 0. Introduction ======

This document will explain step-by-step how to configure and run QDREC.


====== 1. Configure and Run MySQL ======

First make any desired changes the MySQL's my.cnf configuration file.
Instructions for configuring the my.cnf can be found in the MySQL 
documentation files.

Next, run the MySQL server. This will need to be repeated every time
QDREC is to be run.

If the official MySQL installer or operating system package was used
(instead of the tarball or zip archive), then this step is not needed
as MySQL will already be running in the background.
                
Simply open a command window or terminal and use the command:
$ mysqld --console

This will run the server and output messages to the console window.

The FIRST TIME ONLY running QDREC, after the MySQL server is running,
open a second command window or terminal.

Log into the MySQL command line client as the root user:
$ mysql -u root

You will then see the MySQL command prompt.

Create the QDREC database:

> create database phenome_trainer2;

Once the query completes, exit the mysql client and close the command window.


====== 2. Configure QDREC ======

Before running QDREC a few configuration steps must be dealt with.

First, copy the correct platform versions of javabuilder.jar and phenomj.jar
into the QDREC lib directory. The javabuilder and PhenomJ jars are found under
the PhenomJ directory in the QDREC project files.

Next, edit the Config.groovy file, under the grails-app/conf directory in the
QDREC project files. Make the following changes:

On line 71, change the dataDir path to point to location of the QDREC
project on your system. For example, change
    dataDir = "C:/Users/da/Documents/IDEAProjects/qdrec/app-data"
to
    dataDir = "C:/Users/MyUser/qdrec/app-data"


On line 72, change the svmsFile path to point to location of the QDREC
project on your system. For example, change
    svmsFile = "C:/Users/da/Documents/IDEAProjects/qdrec/app-data/svms.mat"
to
    svmsFile = "C:/Users/MyUser/qdrec/app-data/svms.mat"

On line 82, change the path of the QDREC log file to the location of the
QDREC project on your system. For example, change
    rollingFile name: 'file', file:'C:/Users/da/Documents/IDEAProjects/qdrec/qdrec.log'
to
    rollingFile name: 'file', file:'C:/Users/MyUser/qdrec/qdrec.log'


====== 3. Run QDREC ======

QDREC is now ready to run.

Open a new command window or terminal, and navigate to the QDREC
project directory.

Next, use the command:
$ grails run-app

When QDREC has started, a message will appear to browse to

http://localhost/8080/qdrec/

in your web browser.

If there is an error in starting QDREC, try using the commands:
$ grails clean
$ grails run-app
